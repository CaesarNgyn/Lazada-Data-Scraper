# Lazada-Data-Scraper
Lazada Data Scraper using Python

This project is a web scraping tool designed to extract product information from Lazada, a popular e-commerce platform. The scraper is implemented using Python and leverages key libraries like Selenium and BeautifulSoup to navigate the website, handle dynamic content, and parse HTML.

Key Features:
- Automated Web Navigation: Utilizes Selenium WebDriver to automate the process of navigating through Lazada's web pages. This is especially useful for handling JavaScript-rendered content, which cannot be easily scraped using simple HTTP requests.

- Dynamic Content Handling: The scraper waits for dynamic content to load before extracting the necessary information, ensuring that all relevant data is captured even if it is loaded asynchronously.

- Data Extraction: Extracts key product details such as titles, prices, ratings, brands, and review counts from Lazada product listings. The data is organized into a structured format for easy analysis and storage.

- Error Handling: Includes mechanisms to handle potential errors, such as missing data or unresponsive elements, ensuring that the scraper runs smoothly without crashing.

- Output: The extracted data is stored in a dictionary, which can then be converted into various formats, such as CSV, for further analysis.

Use Cases:
- Market Research: Analyze pricing, product availability, and customer sentiment by collecting data from Lazada.

- Competitive Analysis: Monitor competitor products and their performance on the platform.

- Data Aggregation: Collect large datasets for machine learning models, such as price prediction or demand forecasting.

This Lazada Data Scraper is a robust tool for anyone needing to gather and analyze product data from one of Southeast Asia's leading e-commerce platforms.
